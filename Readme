My snippets used on Gedit.

To use them, just install the snippet plugin for Gedit, and copy these files in ~/.gnome2/gedit/snippets

jsunittest is a port of Dr Nic texmate bundle (http://github.com/drnic/javascript-unittest-tmbundle/tree/master)
sugartext are snippets for SugarTest framework (http://sugartest.scriptia.net/)

I'll improve these snippets with a Jquery one quickly.

Other snippets are not from me, founded on the web.
